\section{Syllabus Review}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Pictures + Computer are ok so long as they're used for note taking.
        \item Expect for the tests to be at ends of the first third of the class, and the second third of the class.
        \item Theoretically this is a graduate course, and will be switched to 852, rather than remaining as 452.
    \end{enumerate}
